*Continuum* is a simple notes repository where I irregularly post my notes; a new start which is marked by 2023-May-15. But there are notes that predate May 15 which appear as archived material.

I write mostly by hand to think and understand. And I keep what I write for present and future reference. This writing exercise, often daily, serves as an excellent memory aid especially as I get older.

My workflow for *continuum* is outlined [here](2023-09-13-3-page-site.html) which has been unproblematic. Thus, I've managed to stay away from the latest blog software or fancy static site generators. I like the fact that continuum is a kind of *hand-made* website.
