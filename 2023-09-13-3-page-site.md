>Make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler. – Albert Einstein

My website is essentially three pages, that is, I normally work with three pages[^1] only:

1. `YYYY-MM-DD-latest_note.html`
2. `index.html`
3. `now.html`
   
It goes like this: • generate `YYYY-MM-DD-latest_note.html`, • update `index.html` with a link to `YYYY-MM-DD-latest_note.html`. If needed, • update `now.html`. And • upload all three files to the web server. That's it.

I use ~~[Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com)~~ [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to create and maintain my notes in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and an Obsidian plugin[^2] exports to html quite nicely. Had the web browsers supported `.md` files natively, I would have skipped the conversion step.

[^1]: Of course there are `n` number of content pages (e.g. `YYYY-MM-DD-~.html`). Thus the website contains `n+2` pages.
